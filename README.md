# SkinSense
An android app that uses machine learning to detect the three most common types of skin cancer: Basal Cell Caricinoma, Squamous Cell Caricinoma, and Malignant Melanoma. The neural network is intended to compare the distance between distinctive features of an image, including color, patterns, and clusters of the person's skin. The native application sends the image to the machine learning for classification and the probability of each skin cancer is displayed to the user.

This project was made by Ryan Lee, Daniel Bondar, and Michael Batavia.
